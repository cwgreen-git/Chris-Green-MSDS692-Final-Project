# Chris-Green-MSDS692-Final-Project
Documents, files, and code for my final MSDS692 Practicum Project
The attached files are my submission for the requirements to complete the MSDS692 Data Science Practicum at Regis University.

For my final project, I dove into an analysis of extremist ideological trends inside the United States. My goals for this project project were threefold. First, I wanted to use visualization to inform and educate on what violent extremism and radical ideologies in the U.S. look like from a data perspective. Second, I wanted to test our current assessment of ideological trends. Finally, I wanted to explore new analytic methods and see if machine learning can help analysts identify trends faster.

For the process, I also set a goal to try to implement a skill I had learned in each class over the past year. The results of this effort were as follows:

•	MSC575/MSDS600: The foundational Python skills were used throughout the project
•	MSDS610: While this was not a data engineering-heavy project, I did refer to principles of data governance when looking at how START collected and categorized data.
•	MSDS650: I used the code I developed for supervised machine learning and natural language processing for the KNN model and the word cloud.
•	MSDS670: I relied heavily on the concepts and skills from this class to generate the visuals. I referred to the Tufte and Knaflic references often and used Matplotlib skills to generate the heatmap.
•	MSDS674: I went back and used ArcGIS Pro to generate the bubble map showing where attacks happened most often.
•	MSDS692: I followed the OSEMN framework from the discussion in Week 2 as a framework for my project.
